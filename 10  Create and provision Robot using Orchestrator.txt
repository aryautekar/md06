1. In Orchestrator, on the Robots page, click Add. The options to add a Standard Robot or a Floating Robot are displayed.
2. Click the Standard Robot button. The Create a New Standard Robot window is displayed.
3. Select the Standard Machine you want to register your Robot on. There are two possibilities:
a. You had already created the machine on the Machines page beforehand. In this case, you 
can select it from the Machine drop-down list.
b. You had not created the machine. In this case, simply type the name of a new one on the Machines field and click the Provision Machine button. Note that this step also adds the 
machine in the Machines page.
4. In the Name field, type any name for the Robot.
5. In the Domain\Username field, type the username that is used to login to the specified 
machine. If the user is in a domain, you are required to specify it in 
	a DOMAIN\username format. You must use short domain names, such as desktop\administrator and NOT desktop.local/administrator.
6. Add the Windows password for the specified username.
7. Select the desired robot type from the Type drop-down list. For more information, see 
the About Robots page.
8. Add a description for the Robot. We recommend populating this field, especially 
when dealing with an environment with many robots.
